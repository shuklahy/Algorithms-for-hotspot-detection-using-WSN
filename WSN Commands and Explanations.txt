Device :
1. Programming Board : MIB520CB
2. Processor board : Micaz


Installing MoteWorks Applications into a Mote:

1.  make iris install mib520,com5

2. make <platform> re|install,<n> <programmer>,<port>
	install - compiles and downloads into node
	reinstall - downloads precompiled file into node.
	n - node id(optional)

Setting the Group ID and Node Address for the Mote Network:

The default group ID is 0x7d. You can set the group ID by defining the preprocessor symbol DEFAULT_LOCAL_GROUP in a MakeMemslocal file which is located in /MoteWorks/apps/ directory. Section 3.8 has information about how to edit a MakeMemslocal file. In addition, the message header carries the destination node number, which is a 16-bit value.

IMPORTANT: Except for decimal numbers 126 (the TOS_UART_ADDR 0x007E) and 255 (the TOS_BCAST_ADDR 0xFFFF), all other values between 0 and 65535 are permissible. The number 0 is typically reserved for the base station Mote.

eg:  make mica2 install,38 mib520,com3
