# Hotspot Detection in Data Centres using Wireless Sensor Networks
 
 This project conatins code for temperatur and voltage sensing, communicating them effectively via group of motes and reporting them to base station. This information can then be utilized for detecting hotspot in data centres and appropriate actions can be taken.

### Wireless Sensor Network Mote Details (on which this algo was implemented)
* Programming Board: MIB520CB
* Processor Board: MicaZ
* Sensor Board: MTS400

The overall chip platform is called _IRIS_

We have developed and implemented following 3 algorithms -
* Direct Reporting System (DRS)
* Smart Pinging without Groups (SPWG)
* Smart Pinging with Groups (SPG)

In terms of battery power consumed, the SPWG algorithm uses 25.11% less battery power and the SPG algorithm uses
48.37% lesser battery power as compared to DRS.
